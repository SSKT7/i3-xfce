This a fully customised ricing . I have combined xfce4 and i3 with my debian 12 bookworm.
In my opinion it is a perfect combination of desktop environment and window manager . I took this concept from pop os . But pop os uses too much ram . So this is the best combo for me atleast.

Installation Method :
1. Install i3 and jetbrainsmono font
2. Disable xfce4 session
3. Add i3 on startup
4. Copy paste my file with yours
5. You must install all the required dependencies . Find out the dependencies on your own . (Google is your friend)
6. Now you are good to go. Just logout and login as default session.

Note : This dotfile for my personal backup . And I took my i3 config file from rinshelters github page.
